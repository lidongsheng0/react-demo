Friday night
Let's make a todolist for fun

- [ ] 1st, make a todolist of this todolist haha
- [x] as usual, npx create-react-app
- [x] apparently we are going to use redux, what else dependency we are going to use? for now it's just redux
- [x] lets make the index then level by level break down what we need to implement
- [ ] store -> reducers: reducers/todos.js to add or toggle a todo, reducers/Showtype.js to show_all or show_todo show_done   ; actions: addtodo, toggletodo, showtodos(all, todo or done)
- [ ] App -> <Addtodo>; <Todolist>; <Footer>
